  fatalf.054.desc:0 "有趣的是，每个目前激活的L星门都开始发射一系列脉冲，而你的传感器发现银河系的超空间网络已经开始损毁。原因似乎来自银河系中的每一个L星门，这意味着在帝国设法控制每个L星门进行研究之前，超空间航道将继续不可预测地改变。"
  fatalf.055.title:0 "超空间航道瓦解"
  fatalf.055.desc:0 "现在L星团已经开放，L星门开始以全功率上线。但奇怪的是，你的远程传感器正探测到来自它们的一系列大脉冲，这些脉冲正在扰乱超空间航道网络。如果我们想找到原因，我们需要控制每个L星门。"
  fatalf.057.title:0 "超空间航道机器"
  fatalf.057.desc:0 "控制每个L星门已经向你揭示了超空间航道瓦解的秘密。似乎每个L星门都有一个信号器，它是一台大型机器的一部分，它从天然的超空间航路旁边吸取能量。它们将能量传送到与自然现象明显不同的方向。如果机器被激活到全功率状态，它将改变银河系的景观，同时也会显示一些已失去超空间连接的原始星系。"

  fatalf.071.desc:0 "I am [lost_country.GetRulerTitle] [lost_country.GetRulerName] of the [lost_country.GetName]. Please pardon our sudden arrival, but time was of the essence, and our empire was far too lost to help, so we fled through a dimensional rift we were researching. From what we see, we are you, but traveled along a different path, so we hope that you will assist us. We have far too many citizens, and far too few resources. Will you help us?"
  fatalf.071.response:0 "Our technology had advanced to a similar point as yours not too long ago, when we made a grave mistake. A certain harmful fungus that we were studying had achieved rapid mutation into a sort of deadly pathogen. By the time we discovered the cause, our entire empire was affected. We were able to create a vaccine for the few who still lived, and spent all of our remaining resources finding a way through the rift we previously discovered."

When questioned about where they disappeared to, they tell tale of how they were mysteriously transported to the surface of a pristine, perfect planet. While there, they considered that there was likely a natural wormhole with an extremely high uncertainty and predictability within the system, and with the right efforts, we could stabilize it and travel to that planet."
  fatalf.076.title:0 "Wormhole Stabilization"
  fatalf.076.desc:0 "We have managed to temporarily stabilize the wandering wormhole, and now all that remains is to send our ships through. There is no guarantee it will stay open after the first use, so we must prepare all that we can for our first force."
  fatalf.077.title:0 "Energy Release"
  fatalf.077.desc:0 "Shortly after our ships pass through the wormhole, it closes and emits a large burst of energy throughout the system that disrupts sensors all over the galaxy. All ships we had in the system have disappeared. Strangely though, the wormhole has grown to a size expected of a natural one, become properly stable, and leads to somewhere new. Will we ever see our colonists again?"
